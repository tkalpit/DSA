Graphs: Collections of vertices which are connected to each other using edges.
Vertex / Node: A Node.
Edge / Connection: Connection between nodes.

Types of graph:
 - Undirected Graph: No direction defined (Request to friend in facebook).
 - Directed Graph: Directions defined between 2 nodes. (Follow in instagram)
 - Weighted Graph: Values are defined on edges.

Techniques to define connections between nodes:
 - Adjacency matrix: 2d Matrix define nodes 1 and 0 if connected then 1 else 0.
 - Adjacency List: Nested array where index is node and values are connected node with that node.

FYI: We will use adjecency list and we are building undirected graph.

Graph Traversal:
Uses:
 - Peer to peer networking
 - Web crawlers
 - Finding closest
 - Shortest path problems
  - GPS Navigation
  - Solving mazes
  - AI (shortest path to win the game)

DFS:
 - First visit neighbour then neighbour's all connected nodes.

BFS: 
 - First visit all neighbour's then its connected nodes.

Dijkstra's Algorithm:
 - Used to find a shortest path from nodeA to nodeB.

Uses:
 - GPS: finding fastest route
 - Network Routing: finds open shortest path for data.
 - Airline tickets: finding cheapest route to your destination.

FYI: We are using priority queue to find shortest path.
