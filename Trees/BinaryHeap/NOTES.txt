Binary heaps: Same as BST except max binary and min binary concept. Used to implement Priority Queues.
used with graph travesal algorithms also.
For finding parent: If parent at n then left child at 2n+1 and right at 2n+2
For finding child: If child at n then parent at (n-1)/2
FYI: Same as binary search tree except some cases.
MaxBinaryHeap: Parent always greater than childrenâ€™s.
MinBinaryHeap: Parent always lesser than children's.
FYI: Insert: Insert element in last index (push) then check inserted element with parent if greater than parent then swap with parent loop through it.
FYI: Remove (Extract): Remove element from first index (shift) end put last element to first index (unshift) then check the updated element with its left and right child if lesser than swap loop through it.
 
FYI: Binary heap are good for insertion and removal

----------------Binary Heap Complexity--------------
Insertion: O(log n)
Removal: O(log n)
Search : O(n)
