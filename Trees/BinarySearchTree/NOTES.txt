Binary Tree: Parent should have only 2 node max.
Binary Search Tree (BST): Left side node should be smaller than parent and Right side node should be greater than parent.

Time Complexity: BEST CASE (not gureented in worst case)
Insertion: O(log n)
Searching: O(log n)

BFS: Same level tree we need to visit top to bottom
DFS: PreOrder, PostOrder, InOrder
PreOrder: First left then its right top to bottom
PostOrder: Bottom to top left to right
InOrder: Bottom to top first all left then right
