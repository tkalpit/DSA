Dynamic Programming: Break down complex problem into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions.
 - Example: Memoization

Overlapping Subproblems: A problem is said to have Overlapping subproblems if it can be broken down into subproblems which are reused several times.
 - Example: Fibonacci Sequence, Merge Sort.

Optimal Substructure: A problem is said to have optimal Substructure if an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems.
 - Example: Shortest path

Memoization: Caching result
Tebulation: Store in array (table)
